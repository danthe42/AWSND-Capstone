# AWSND-Capstone
Udacity cloud-developer capstone project

It uses a React JS frontent and a serverless AWS backend (Api Gateway, Lambdas, DynamoDB and an S3 filestore). 



This is a cloud-based application, with which:

- A user can publish a product (book, software, item, anything),
- Write a review/description (with image) about  it,
- And all other registered users can comment/review it. 

Only the user who created the product can edit its properties, or delete it.

Everybody else is free to add reviews to the product.

The product can have a Title, a Description, and an Image. A review is just a description text. Users can register with their email address & password, or can use their Microsoft, Facebook, Gmail or Github account. 



Other enhancement ideas/future plans:

- ratings. definitely they are necessary

- better frontend: I'm not a UX/web-designer, the frontend is ugly, sorry ! 

- Multiple images for a product 

- Edit review (only by its author)

- User profiles/normal usernames for the reviews

- Websocket connection and refresh reviews in real time when necessary

- Product image is missing from the Reviews screen
